Problem Statement: Rising climate change in India has led to an increase in extreme events, causing significant socioeconomic damage. 
                   The need is for a platform to visualize, report, and mitigate these events effectively to reduce their overall impact.
 Track:
(This document should not exceed given pages. Keep the abstract short and precise.)

Problem identified:
India faces numerous extreme climate events due to climate change, such as floods, droughts,
and cyclones, which result in devastating socioeconomic damage.Despite existing efforts, there is
no comprehensive platform to visualize historical data, predict future high-risk areas,
and collaborate on innovative solutions to mitigate these risks. This gap highlights the 
need for an integrated platform to address climate-induced extreme events and their impacts.

Market Research:
   Who are your customers and end-users?
    Government agencies and policymakers.
    NGOs working on climate change and disaster management.
    Environmental scientists and researchers.
    Citizens living in vulnerable regions.
    Corporates and industries impacted by climate risks.
  What are the solutions already available in the market for your problem?
    Disaster monitoring systems like India Meteorological Department (IMD) warnings.
    Satellite-based climate monitoring platforms.

   // How is your solution better than existing solutions?
Provides real-time interactive visualizations of climate data on a map.
Predicts high-risk areas using AI-based analysis and displays reasons for vulnerability.
Facilitates collaboration through solutions submissions and discussions.
Offers a resource hub and a reporting mechanism for live events.
